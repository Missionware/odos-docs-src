## General Notes

ODOS has been undergone an extensive refactoring and migration from the legacy .NET Framework to .NET Standard, .NET Core and currently to .NET 5.0/6.0. Generally all of the core libraries of ODOS currently multitarget .NET Standard 2.0 and .NET 5.0. 

## Windows

ODOS is compatible with MS Windows under .NET Framework 4.8 and .NET 5.0. Also Mono and .NET Core should be supported but no extensive testing has been performed. ODOS has been tested and is fully supported on Windows 7, 8 and 10. 

### UWP

ODOS is currently available for building UWP applications. However our plan is to drop support for UWP and support fully WinUI.

## Linux

ODOS is compatible with Linux under .NET 5.0. Mono and .NET Core are probably also supported but no extensive testing has been performed.

## MacOS

ODOS is probably compatible with MacOS under .NET 5.0 and Mono but no testing has been performed yet.
